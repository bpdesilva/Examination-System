# Examination System

The institute of XYZ is a leading computer school which offers IT Education Island wide. Knowledge of
the students registered in the institute are assessed through exams. The top management of the
institute has decided to use an Online Examination Management System (OEMS) for this process.
OEMS is a term to manage the exam system in terms of student registered for exam. Each and every
student registered in the system for a particular course will get a username and password to login to
the OEMS.

A student should face an exam for each module of the course he enrolls in, where a course is consisted
of multiple modules. Each module exam is consisting of 15 multiple choice questions; each question
has four choices with only one correct answer. Exam questions should be taken randomly from a pool
of questions related to the module. A student has only three attempts for an exam and he should
score more than 50% of the correct answers in each and every module exam to complete the course
successfully. The system should also facilitate students to view their exam scores and the overall
average score.

access to the system.
